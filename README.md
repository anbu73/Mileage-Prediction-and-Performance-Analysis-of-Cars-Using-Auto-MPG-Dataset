The Mileage Prediction and Performance Analysis of Cars Using the Auto-MPG Dataset aims to analyze and predict the fuel efficiency of various vehicles based on key factors like horsepower, weight, displacement, and cylinder count. Using data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and machine learning models, the project identifies trends affecting miles per gallon (MPG). This analysis helps in understanding vehicle performance and optimizing fuel efficiency, benefiting both manufacturers and consumers in making informed decisions
